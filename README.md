# WorkingThroughKaggleDataset-1

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook that I used to present at "Working Through a Kaggle Dataset" at "All Things Python Meetup" https://www.meetup.com/All-Things-Python/events/253174922/

The folder data/kickstarter contains two csv files. For the presentation, I used ks_projects1.csv.
